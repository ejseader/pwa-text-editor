# Module 19 - J.A.T.E PWA Text Editor

## Summary

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">J</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold; color:orange;">A</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">T</span>.E. - Just Another Text Editor - is anything but! Not merely just a text editor that runs in the browser, the app also functions offline as a standalone notepad. It is a single-page PWA (<span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkgreen;">P</span>rogressive <span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkgreen;">W</span>eb <span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkgreen;">A</span>pp) which features a myriad of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the user's browser.

## Installation and Usage

This PWA was built in VS Code using npm packages [babel-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader) [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently), [css-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader) [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin), [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mini-css-extract-plugin), [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack), [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli), [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server), [webpack-pwa-manifest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-pwa-manifest), and [workbox-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-webpack-plugin).

Since this page has been [deployed to Heroku](https://hidden-tundra-78494.herokuapp.com/), a user does not need to install these packages locally to use the app. Simply visit [https://hidden-tundra-78494.herokuapp.com/](https://hidden-tundra-78494.herokuapp.com/) and begin typing. To save your work, click anywhere in the blue space of the header and then reload to confirm your save. If you would like to pop the text editor out as a standalone app, simply click the Install button to install a local copy that will persist with your input.
